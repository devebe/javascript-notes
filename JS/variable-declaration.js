let message;
// Declaring variable message that will store information

message = "Hello";
// Store the string "Hello World" in variable named message

console.log(message);
// Show the content that is stored in variable message

let firstname = "John";
// Declaring a variable message and immediately storing information
// in it is possible too.

let user;

user = firstname;
// Copies data from one variable into another

console.log(message+" "+user);
// User will show the same as firstname

// When changing the stored information in a variable, one should not
// use let twice as it will run into an error.

// Variable naming rules

// - The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
// - The first character must not be a digit.
// - Variables are case-sensitive so APPLE and apple are not the same
// - Words such as let, class, return and function are reserved
//   and cannot be used.

// For longer names camelCasing is used
