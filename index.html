        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h3>Using console.log()</h3>
        <p>
            <a class="code">console.log()</a> is the command to print something to the developer console 
            in your browser. You can use this to print the results from any of the 
            following articles and exercises to the console. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scripts</h3>
        <p>
            The <a class="code">script</a> tag in html is used to add Javascript code. This can be done
            inside the HTML itself or refer to a .js document.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first line in the console will actually show the script that is inside the html body to print 
            "Hello World". The second line will show this message coming from a Javascript file
            that was linked to this file (hello-world.js).
        </p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>
            A box to store information in, typically uses the words 
            <a class="code">let, var, const</a>. It is possible to immediately
            declare the information that needs to be stored or to do it later.
        </p>
        <p>Some naming rules</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.</li>
            <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
            <li>Variables are case-sensitive so <a class="code">APPLE</a> and <a class="code">apple</a> are not the same</li>
            <li>Words such as let, class, return and function are reserved and cannot be used.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Math operators and operands</h3>
        <p>
            Javascript can be used to do mathematics. All rules with regards to mathematics apply. In some cases, addition
            and string concatenation (putting two strings together) may collide. When doing mathematics in Javascript,
            normal presedence (multiplication before addition) are in effect.
        </p>
        <p>Important definitions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Operands are numbers or variables that an operation is done on</li>
            <li>Operators are the signs that indicate a certain operation is done</li>
            <li>Numbers in Javascript may not always be very precise</li>
            <li>The function <a class="code">typeof</a> can be used to determine if you are looking at a number or something else </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Data types in Javascript</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Number: can represent both integer and floating point numbers. They will take most mathematical operations and
                can include the values <a class="code">NaN</a> (not a number), <a class="code">-Infinity</a> and <a class="code">Infinity</a>. 
            </li>
            <li>BigInt: All integers above 2^53 - 1 cannot be stored in number, as do values smaller than - (2^53 - 1).
                BigInt solves this problem. It is created through appending an "n" to the end of a number.
            </li>
            <li>String: can hold quotes. The type of quotation used makes a difference. <a class="code">" "</a>  (double quotes), 
                <a class="code">' '</a> (single quotes) and <a class="code">` `</a>(backticks) are supported formatting for quotes. 
                Backticks offer more functionality and allow for embedding variables
                and expressions into a string by wrapping them in <a class="code">${...}</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Boolean: Can only hold true and false as values. One of the most common logical operators.</li>
            <li>Null: Represents nothing, empty or value unknown.</li>
            <li>Undefined: Represents that a value is not assigned. If a variable gets declared but does not get a value, Undefined
                will be returned.
            </li>
            <li>Object: objects were made to store multiple entities, whereas other previously mentioned data types allow for the
                storage of one specific thing (called primitive data types). Symbols are used as a way to create unique identifiers 
                for objects.
            </li>
            <li>Typeof: allows to evaluate the argument of a variable for their data type. Useful for a quick check.</li>
        </ul>
