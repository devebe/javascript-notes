        <h3>Using console.log()</h3>
        <p>
            <a class="code">console.log()</a> is the command to print something to the developer console 
            in your browser. You can use this to print the results from any of the 
            following articles and exercises to the console.
        </p>
        <h3>Scripts</h3>
        <p>
            The <a class="code">script</a> tag in html is used to add Javascript code. This can be done
            inside the HTML itself or refer to a .js document.
        </p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>
            A box to store information in, typically uses the words 
            <a class="code">let, var, const</a>. It is possible to immediately
            declare the information that needs to be stored or to do it later.
        </p>
        <p>Some naming rules</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.</li>
            <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
            <li>Variables are case-sensitive so <a class="code">APPLE</a> and <a class="code">apple</a> are not the same</li>
            <li>Words such as let, class, return and function are reserved and cannot be used.</li>
        </ol>
